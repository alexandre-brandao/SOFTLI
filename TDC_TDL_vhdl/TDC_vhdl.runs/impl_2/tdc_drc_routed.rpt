2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
27 out of 27 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: measurement_o[20:0], clk_i, en_tdc_i, nrst_i, start_i, stop_i, valid_o.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
27 out of 27 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: measurement_o[20:0], clk_i, en_tdc_i, nrst_i, start_i, stop_i, valid_o.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net C is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin rising_edge_tdc_rst_i_1/O, cell rising_edge_tdc_rst_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net synchronizer_inst/DELAY_LINE_Full is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin synchronizer_inst/DELAY_LINE_Full_reg_i_2/O, cell synchronizer_inst/DELAY_LINE_Full_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net synchronizer_inst/StoreLastPiece_en_w is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin synchronizer_inst/FSM_onehot_state[3]_i_1/O, cell synchronizer_inst/FSM_onehot_state[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net synchronizer_inst/s_ready_FirstPiece_therm0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin synchronizer_inst/s_ready_FirstPiece_therm_reg_i_1/O, cell synchronizer_inst/s_ready_FirstPiece_therm_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT rising_edge_tdc_rst_i_1 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
rising_edge_tdc_rst/Type2.Q_reg
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
