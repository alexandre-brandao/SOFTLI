[Analog Devices Inc.](http://www.analog.com/en/index.html) Software drivers for systems without OS.


## Software

The majority of ADI's products are peripherals to a non-ADI digital engine (FPGA, microprocessor, or microcontroller). While there is major work underway on FPGAs (Xilinx and Intel/Altera) and microprocessors (running an operating system like Linux), the efforts on microcontrollers are fragmented due to the diverse nature of the microcontroller market. The goal of these projects (microcontroller/no-OS) is to be able to provide reference projects for lower end processors, which can't run Linux or aren't running a specific operating system, to help customers using FPGA/microcontrollers with ADI parts.
